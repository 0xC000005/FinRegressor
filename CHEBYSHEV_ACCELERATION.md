# Chebyshev Polynomial Methods for Accelerating Black-Scholes Calculations

## Overview

Chebyshev polynomials are used in multiple ways to accelerate Black-Scholes option pricing computations. These methods leverage the extremal properties and excellent approximation characteristics of Chebyshev polynomials to achieve significant speedups while maintaining or improving accuracy.

## Main Approaches

### 1. Chebyshev Interpolation for Parametric Option Pricing

**Concept**: Instead of computing option prices from scratch for every parameter combination, pre-compute prices at strategic Chebyshev nodes and use polynomial interpolation for intermediate values.

**Key Features**:
- Interpolates in the parameter space (not the spatial domain)
- Separates computation into offline (expensive) and online (fast) phases
- Achieves (sub)exponential convergence with explicit error bounds
- Works with any underlying pricing method (Fourier, PDE, Monte Carlo)

**Performance**:
- Considerably reduces run-times while maintaining accuracy
- More efficient than parametric multilevel Monte Carlo for many problems
- Real-time evaluation consists only of polynomial evaluation

**Applications**:
- European, American, Bermudan, and barrier options
- Multiple asset models (stochastic volatility, jump processes)
- High-dimensional problems using tensor train formats

### 2. Dynamic Chebyshev Method for American Options

**Concept**: At each time step of the backward induction algorithm, approximate the value function using Chebyshev polynomials.

**Key Features**:
- Shifts model-dependent computations to offline phase
- Online backward induction solved on discrete Chebyshev grid
- No conditional expectations needed in online phase
- Delivers closed-form approximation of price function plus Greeks (delta, gamma)

**Advantages**:

### 3. Super-Time-Stepping (STS) with Chebyshev Acceleration

**Concept**: Use modified Chebyshev polynomials to overcome the CFL stability restriction of explicit finite difference schemes for the Black-Scholes PDE.

**Technical Details**:
- Belongs to Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev class of methods
- Second-order accurate in time
- Spatial order determined by chosen discretization scheme
- Liberates explicit schemes from severe time-step restrictions

**Performance**:

### 4. Chebyshev Spectral and Pseudo-Spectral Methods

**Concept**: Use Chebyshev polynomials as global basis functions with collocation at Chebyshev nodes to solve the Black-Scholes PDE.

**Convergence Properties**:
- Spectral accuracy: convergence rate O(N^-m) where m depends on solution regularity
- For smooth functions, achieves high-order accuracy (higher N → higher accuracy)
- Can achieve sixth-order or eighth-order spatial accuracy with compact schemes

**Challenges**:
- Discontinuities in initial conditions (e.g., payoff functions) prevent high accuracy
- Performance degrades near singularities

**Variants**:
- Second-kind Chebyshev collocation for spatial derivatives
- Third-kind Chebyshev collocation for fractional derivatives
- Rational spectral collocation for unbounded domains

**Applications**:
- Time-fractional Black-Scholes equations
- Heston stochastic volatility model
- Multi-asset options with Chebyshev tensor products

## Comparison of Approaches

| Method | Primary Use Case | Speed Gain | Accuracy | Complexity |
|--------|------------------|------------|----------|------------|
| Parametric Interpolation | Repeated pricing with varying parameters | Very High | (Sub)exponential convergence | Medium |
| Dynamic Chebyshev | American/Bermudan options | High | High, includes Greeks | Medium-High |
| Super-Time-Stepping | Explicit PDE schemes | High | 2nd order time, user-defined space | Low-Medium |
| Spectral/Pseudo-Spectral | Smooth solutions, high accuracy needs | Medium | Spectral (limited by regularity) | High |

## Implementation Considerations

### When to Use Chebyshev Interpolation
- Need to price options repeatedly with different parameters
- Parameters span a continuous range (strikes, maturities, volatilities)
- Can afford upfront offline computation cost
- Real-time pricing response required

### When to Use Super-Time-Stepping
- Using explicit finite difference schemes
- CFL stability constraint is too restrictive
- Parabolic PDE structure (Black-Scholes, heat equation)
- Medium accuracy requirements acceptable

### When to Use Spectral Methods
- Solution expected to be very smooth
- High accuracy required
- Computational resources available for dense linear systems
- Domain is bounded or can use rational basis for unbounded domains

## Key Mathematical Advantages of Chebyshev Polynomials

1. **Optimal Approximation**: Among all polynomial interpolations, Chebyshev nodes minimize the Runge phenomenon
2. **Extremal Property**: Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind have the smallest maximum deviation from zero
3. **Fast Transformation**: FFT-like algorithms (DCT) enable O(N log N) transformations
4. **Nested Grids**: Chebyshev nodes can be nested for adaptive refinement
5. **Explicit Formulas**: Recurrence relations enable stable, efficient evaluation

## Limitations and Challenges

1. **Non-Smooth Solutions**: Performance degrades for discontinuous payoffs (digital options, barriers)
2. **Domain Issues**: Standard Chebyshev polynomials defined on [-1, 1], requiring transformation
3. **Boundary Conditions**: Spectral methods require careful treatment of boundary conditions
4. **Implementation Complexity**: More complex than standard finite difference methods
5. **High Dimensionality**: Curse of dimensionality for multi-asset options (mitigated by sparse grids or low-rank tensors)

## Practical Speedup Techniques

1. **Sparse Grids**: Combine Chebyshev polynomials with sparse grid techniques for high-dimensional problems

# Chebyshev Tensors: Advanced High-Dimensional Methods

## Overview

Chebyshev tensors combine the approximation power of Chebyshev polynomials with tensor decomposition techniques to overcome the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional financial applications. This approach enables efficient computation for problems involving many parameters (e.g., multiple strikes, maturities, underlying assets, model parameters).

## The Curse of Dimensionality Problem

**Standard Chebyshev Interpolation Challenge**:
- For d parameters with n grid points each, full tensor grid requires n^d evaluations
- Example: 10 parameters with 20 points each = 20^10 ≈ 10^13 evaluations (infeasible)
- Storage and computation scale exponentially with dimension

**Tensor Methods Solution**:
- Exploit low-rank structure in pricing functions
- Reduce n^d complexity to O(d × n × r^2), where r is the tensor rank (typically small)
- Enable practical computation in 10-25+ dimensions

## Tensor Representations

### 1. Full Tensor Format

**Structure**:
- Complete d-dimensional array of Chebyshev coefficients
- Size: n₁ × n₂ × ... × n_d

**Limitations**:
- Exponential storage: O(n^d)
- Only feasible for d ≤ 3-4 dimensions
- Serves as conceptual starting point

### 2. Tensor Train (TT) Format

**Structure**:
- Decomposes d-dimensional tensor into product of 3D cores
- Tensor A(i₁, i₂, ..., i_d) = G₁(i₁) × G₂(i₂) × ... × G_d(i_d)
- Each core G_k has size r_{k-1} × n_k × r_k
- r_k are the TT-ranks (typically 2-20)

**Advantages**:
- Storage: O(d × n × r²) instead of O(n^d)
- Linear scaling in dimension d
- Stable numerical operations
- Well-developed mathematical theory

**Complexity**:
- Storage: d × n × max(r_k)²
- Evaluation: O(d × r² × n)
- Most operations scale linearly with d

**Applications**:
- Parametric option pricing with many parameters
- Portfolio-level risk calculations
- Multi-asset derivative pricing

### 3. Hierarchical Tucker (HT) Format

**Structure**:
- Tree-based decomposition
- More general than TT (TT is special case with binary tree)
- Better for certain problem structures

**Advantages**:
- Flexible dimension grouping
- Can exploit problem-specific structure
- Sometimes lower ranks than TT for same accuracy

**Complexity**:
- Similar to TT but with tree-dependent constants
- Useful when dimensions have natural hierarchical structure

### 4. Sparse Grid Format (Smolyak Grids)

**Structure**:
- Selects subset of full tensor grid based on total polynomial degree
- Classic approach dating to Smolyak (1963)

**Advantages**:
- Reduces n^d to O(n × (log n)^(d-1)) for certain function classes
- Well-understood approximation theory
- Good for moderate dimensions (d ≤ 10)

**Combination with Chebyshev**:
- Use Chebyshev nodes on each dimension
- Combine with sparse grid selection
- Particularly effective for smooth functions

## Key Algorithms for Chebyshev Tensors

**Typical Speedup**:
- Reduces evaluations by factors of 10³ to 10⁶ for d = 5-10
- Example: d=8, n=20 → from 10¹⁰ to ~10⁴ evaluations

### Tensor Completion

**Purpose**: Approximate tensor from partially observed entries

**Algorithm**:
1. Compute prices at random or strategically chosen parameter points
2. Fit low-rank tensor to observed data
3. Use fitted tensor to interpolate at all Chebyshev nodes
4. Results in complete Chebyshev interpolant

### TT-SVD (TT-Singular Value Decomposition)

**Purpose**: Compress full tensor into TT format

**Algorithm**:
1. Start with full tensor (if available)
2. Apply sequence of SVD decompositions
3. Truncate to desired rank at each step
4. Results in optimal TT approximation

**Advantages**:
